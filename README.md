# quantumcircuitlearning
This is the code of my master's project. Learning quantum circuit using classical gradient descent.

The logic of how the code run is in the experiments files such as encodedtestmnist.py and hybridtestmnist.py
The files prints a lot of logging informations and need the path to run they will not create the appropriate folder.
The iris test will not work as it needs files that are not in the repo.  

This is a very academic code and is not well commented and documented, but as with all academic codes it should be published.
