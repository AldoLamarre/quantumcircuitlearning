The logic of how the code run is in the experiments files such as encodedtestmnist.py and hybridtestmnist.py
The files prints a lot of logging informations and need the path to run they will not create the apropriate folder.
The iris test will not work as it needs files that are not in the repo.  

The code is not well commented and documented good luck.
